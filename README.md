# YAMLNav

YAMLNav is simple utility that let you search through yaml file by path with fuzzy finder and to copy the yaml path
under the cursor.
## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

Right now use the yaml-path binary to parse and extract paths. The binary need to be installed with the following command.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:aubinlrx/yaml-path.git
cd yaml-path
go install
```
